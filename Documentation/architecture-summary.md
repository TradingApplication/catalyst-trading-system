# Trading System v2.0.0 - Architecture Summary

**Date**: June 27, 2025  
**Status**: Ready for Implementation  

## What We've Built

A sophisticated news-driven trading system that:
1. **Collects** news from multiple sources with alignment tracking
2. **Selects** securities based on catalysts, not random scanning  
3. **Validates** with technical analysis as confirmation
4. **Executes** trades with proper risk management
5. **Tracks** outcomes for future ML pattern discovery

## Key Innovations

### 1. News-Driven Architecture
- Traditional: Scan everything → Filter technically
- Ours: News catalyst → Validate interest → Trade opportunity

### 2. Source Alignment Tracking
Beyond accuracy to agenda detection:
- Source tier classification (1-5)
- Confirmation tracking
- Narrative clustering
- Beneficiary pattern analysis

### 3. Clean Data Separation
```
news_raw (untouched) → Scanner Processing → trading_candidates (actionable)
```
- Raw data preserved for ML
- Trading data optimized for execution
- Clear audit trail

### 4. ML-Ready Foundation
Collecting evidence now:
- Which sources precede moves
- Which narratives appear coordinated  
- Who benefits from price action
- Pattern discovery later

## Service Summary

| Service | Port | Purpose | Key Innovation |
|---------|------|---------|----------------|
| News Collection | 5008 | Gather intelligence | Source alignment tracking |
| Security Scanner | 5001 | Select opportunities | News-driven, not random |
| Pattern Analysis | 5002 | Detect setups | Context-aware patterns |
| Technical Analysis | 5003 | Generate signals | Catalyst-weighted signals |

## Data Architecture

### Raw Data (Preserved)
- `news_raw` - All news with rich metadata
- `price_data` - Market data
- `market_metrics` - Broader context

### Trading Data (Derived)
- `trading_candidates` - Top 5 daily picks
- `pattern_results` - Detected patterns
- `trading_signals` - Entry/exit points
- `trade_records` - Execution history

### Intelligence Data (Analytics)
- `source_metrics` - Reliability tracking
- `narrative_clusters` - Coordinated messaging
- `outcome_tracking` - What happened after

## The Money Flow

```
Breaking News (FDA Approval)
    ↓
Source Tier 1 (Bloomberg) + Pre-market timing
    ↓
High Catalyst Score (45/50)
    ↓
Technical Validation (Volume surge confirmed)
    ↓
Pattern Detection (Breakout forming)
    ↓
Signal Generation (BUY @ 89.50, Stop @ 87.25)
    ↓
Trade Execution (100 shares filled)
    ↓
Outcome Tracking (Exit @ 94.30, +5.3%)
    ↓
ML Training Data (FDA + Bloomberg + Pre-market = High probability)
```

## Implementation Priority

1. **Get News Collection Running** ✓
   - Multiple sources configured
   - Alignment tracking active

2. **Connect Scanner to News** ✓
   - News-driven selection
   - Technical validation

3. **Paper Trading Integration** (Next)
   - Connect to Alpaca
   - Start tracking real outcomes

4. **Outcome Feedback Loop**
   - Update news accuracy
   - Track beneficiaries
   - Build ML dataset

## Success Metrics

- **Data Collection**: 1000+ news items/day
- **Selection Quality**: 60%+ of picks move favorably  
- **Pattern Detection**: Higher confidence with catalysts
